# Umbraco search provider for Elasticsearch

This repo contains an alternative search provider for [Umbraco search](https://TODO), based on Elasticsearch 9.

## Prerequisites

An Elasticsearch 9 engine must be available and running üòõ

## Installation

The package is installed from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch):

```
```bash
dotnet add package Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch
```

Once installed, add the search provider to Umbraco by means of composition:

```csharp
using Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch.DependencyInjection;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;

namespace My.Site;

public class SiteComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
        => builder.AddElasticsearchSearchProvider();
}
```

## Connecting to the Elasticsearch engine

You'll need to configure the search provider, so it can connect to your Elasticsearch engine.

This is done either via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "ElasticsearchSearchProvider": {
    "Client": {
      "Host": "[your Elasticsearch host]",
      "Authentication": {
        "ApiKey": "[your API key]"
      },
      "EnableDebugMode": [true/false]
    }
  }
}
```

...or using `IOptions`:

```csharp
using Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch.Configuration;
using Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch.DependencyInjection;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;

namespace My.Site;

public class SiteComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.AddElasticsearchSearchProvider();

        builder.Services.Configure<ClientOptions>(options =>
        {
            options.Host = new("http://localhost:9200");
            options.Authentication = new()
            {
                ApiKey = "my-api-key"
            };
            options.EnableDebugMode = true;
        });
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `EnableDebugMode` enables a _very_ verbose console logging from Elasticsearch. It's useful both for troubleshooting connectivity errors and general debugging.

### Basic authentication

While the API keys are encouraged by Elasticsearch, it is also possible to use basic authentication, provided of course that your engine supports that:

```json
{
  "ElasticsearchSearchProvider": {
    "Client": {
      "Authentication": {
        "Username": "[your user name]",
        "Password": "[your password]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

...or:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<ClientOptions>(options =>
{
    options.Authentication = new()
    {
        Username = "[your user name]",
        Password = "[your password]"
    };
});
```

## Extendability

Generally, you should look to Umbraco search for extension points. There are however a few notable extension points in this search provider as well.

### Tweaking score boosting for textual relevance

TODO: VERIFY DEFAULTS

Umbraco search allows for multiple textual relevance options within a single field. You can change the boost factors of the search provider by configuring the `SearcherOptions`:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<SearcherOptions>(options =>
{
    // boost the highest relevance text by a factor 100 (default is 6)
    options.BoostFactorTextR1 = 100f;
    // boost the second-highest relevance text by a factor 10 (default is 4)
    options.BoostFactorTextR2 = 10f;
    // do not boost the third-highest relevance text at all (default is 2)
    options.BoostFactorTextR1 = 1f;
});
```

### Allowing for more facet values

TODO: VERIFY DEFAULTS

By default, the search provider allows for a maximum of 100 facet values returned per facet in a search result. You can change that - also using `SearcherOptions`:

```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<SearcherOptions>(options =>
{
    // allow fetching 200 facet values per facet
    options.MaxFacetValues = 200;
});
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Increasing the maximum number of facet values per facet can degrade your overall search performance. Use with caution.
