# Running the tests

These tests are created with [NUnit](https://nunit.org/), and are executed against a local Elasticsearch engine.

You can configure the test client connectivity in [appsettings.json](https://github.com/kjac/Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch/blob/main/src/Kjac.SearchProvider.Elasticsearch.Tests/appsettings.json), exactly the same way you'd configure the search provider.
